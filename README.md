Storing ideas and ressources for FreeCodeCamp. Maybe.

I hope to use this repository to store knowledge I have gained on using GitHub and what I have learned in the FreeCodeCamp. Bu tmaybe there will be better places for that, so maybe this repository will stay deserted. We shall see. Stay in school and eat your vitamins.
